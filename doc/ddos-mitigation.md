# DDoS Mitigation

Mitigating a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack at the application layer requires a
combination of technical measures and proactive planning. Here are a few strategies that can help:

1. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN can absorb a significant amount of traffic and
   protect the origin server by caching and serving content.
2. Implement rate limiting: This involves limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given
   time period, which can help prevent an attacker from overwhelming the server with excessive
   traffic.
3. Use security technologies like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs): A WAF can detect and block
   malicious traffic based on rules and algorithms, preventing it from reaching the application
   layer.
4. Monitor network traffic patterns: Regularly monitoring network traffic patterns can help detect a
   DDoS attack early and trigger the mitigation process.
5. Implement load balancing: Load balancing can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers,
   reducing the impact of an attack on a single server.
6. Have a plan in place: Preparation and planning are key to effectively mitigating a DDoS attack.
   This includes having a clear incident response plan, testing it regularly, and having backup
   servers and bandwidth available.

In summary, mitigating a DDoS attack at the application layer requires a combination of technical
measures, proactive planning, and regular monitoring. These strategies can help protect the
application and ensure that it remains available and accessible to users even in the event of a DDoS
attack.
