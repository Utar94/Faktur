# 4. Using FluentValidation

Date: 2023-09-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a tool to make validations easily.

## Decision

We will be using [FluentValidation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/) NuGet packages.

## Consequences

Validating object and properties will be made easily, but more obscure since we won't see code
references to validators.
