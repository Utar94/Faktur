# 5. Using EntityFrameworkCore

Date: 2023-09-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need an object-relational mapping tool to integrate easily with relational databases.

## Decision

We will be using [EntityFrameworkCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) NuGet packages.

## Consequences

It will be easier and faster to integrate relational databases, but developers will need to
understand and mitigate EntityFrameworkCore caveats.
