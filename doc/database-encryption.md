# Database Encryption

PostgreSQL provides several options for encrypting data at rest and in transit. Here are a few
methods to encrypt data in PostgreSQL:

1. Encrypting data at rest using Filesystem Level Encryption: The data on disk can be encrypted
   using file system level encryption such as LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) or BitLocker (on
   Windows). This ensures that the data on disk is encrypted and protected even if the disk is
   stolen or accessed by unauthorized users.
2. Encrypting data in transit using SSL/TLS: The data transmitted over the network can be encrypted
   using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to prevent eavesdropping and
   tampering. To use SSL/TLS with PostgreSQL, you need to configure the server to use SSL and the
   client to connect to the server using SSL.
3. Encrypting data at the column level: The individual columns in a table can be encrypted using the
   pgcrypto extension. This provides a high level of security as the encrypted data is stored within
   the database and decrypted only when retrieved. The pgcrypto extension provides several
   encryption algorithms, including AES and Blowfish, to encrypt data.
4. Encrypting data using the Data at Rest Encryption feature (available in PostgreSQL 13 and later
   versions): This feature provides transparent encryption for the entire database or individual
   tablespaces, without requiring any changes to the application code.

In conclusion, PostgreSQL provides several options for encrypting data, including filesystem level
encryption, SSL/TLS, column-level encryption, and data at rest encryption. The specific encryption
method to be used depends on the specific requirements and security needs of your application.
